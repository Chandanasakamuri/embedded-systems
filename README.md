# 🔧 Embedded Systems Projects – Arduino Based

This repository contains two fundamental embedded systems projects that demonstrate sensor interfacing and digital output control using Arduino:

1. 🌡 Humidity & Temperature Detector
2. 💡 LED Light Blinking

These mini projects serve as a foundation for learning how embedded systems interact with the physical world using sensors and actuators.

### 1️⃣ Humidity & Temperature Detector

A system that measures real-time humidity and temperature using the DHT11/DHT22 sensor and displays the readings via the serial monitor or LCD.

#### 🔌 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- DHT11 / DHT22 sensor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- (Optional) 16x2 LCD display

#### 🧠 Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Accurate digital readings from DHT sensor
- Simple and low-cost environment monitoring setup

#### 📟 How It Works
- The sensor sends digital data to Arduino.
- Arduino reads and processes the temperature & humidity values.
- Results are printed to the Serial Monitor or displayed on an LCD.

### 2️⃣ LED Light Blinking

A basic project to blink an LED at regular intervals using Arduino’s digital output.

#### 🔌 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

#### 🧠 Features
- Understands digital write operations
- Demonstrates delay and toggling
- Great beginner-level hardware practice

#### 💡 How It Works
- Arduino sends HIGH/LOW signals to the LED pin.
- The LED turns ON and OFF at regular delay intervals.
